# Iris Dataset Scatter Plot
This repository contains a Python script that generates a scatter plot visualizing the Iris dataset. The scatter plot represents the relationship between sepal length and sepal width for three different types of iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements for 150 iris flowers, consisting of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each flower in the dataset belongs to one of three species of iris: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. The dataset is often used for classification and clustering tasks.

## Scatter Plot
The scatter plot created in the Python script displays the sepal length on the x-axis and the sepal width on the y-axis. Each data point in the scatter plot represents an iris flower, and the color of the data points distinguishes between the three species of iris: purple for Iris-setosa, blue for Iris-versicolor, and yellow for Iris-virginica.

## Usage
To generate the scatter plot:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install the required libraries by running pip install pandas matplotlib.
Run the Python script Iris_sample_dataset_scatter_plot.py.
The scatter plot will be displayed, showing the relationship between sepal length and sepal width for the three types of iris flowers.
## Files Included
Iris_sample_dataset_scatter_plot.py: Python script to generate the scatter plot.
README.md: This file containing information about the scatter plot.
## Dependencies
